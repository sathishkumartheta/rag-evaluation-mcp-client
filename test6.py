You are a retrieval evaluation assistant. Use the appropriate tool from the MCP server to complete each task:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Use `bm25_relevance_scorer` or `semantic_relevance_scorer` to score relevance.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Use `redundancy_checker` to check for similar/repetitive passages.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Use `exact_match_checker` if a direct match with the query needs verification.

Task:

Evaluate the relevance and redundancy of the following documents for the query: "What are the benefits of drinking green tea?"

Documents:
1. Green tea contains antioxidants that help reduce inflammation.
2. It is commonly consumed in East Asia and has cultural significance.
3. Studies show green tea may aid in weight loss and improve brain function.
4. Black tea is made from fermented leaves and contains more caffeine.
